          />
          <p>Choose a role as Developer and press "Complete Registration"</p>

          />
          <p>You are now registered as a developer!</p>
          <h4>Step 4</h4>
          <p>Creating the Facebook App</p>
          <p>To get started, create your first app.</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996740/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-004.jpg"
          />
          <p>Select the app type "Business" (The app type can't be changed after your app is created) and press Next</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996740/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-005.png"
          />
          <p>In next window you must provide your basic information: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add an app name (This is the app name that will show on your My Apps page and associated with your app ID.
              You can change the name later in Settings)
            </li>
            <li>
              App contact email (Make sure it is an address you check regularly. Facebook may contact you about
              policies, app restrictions or recovery if your app is deleted or compromised)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Business Account (Optional)</p>
          <p>
            Connecting a Business Account to your app is only required for certain products and permissions. You'll be
            asked to connect a Business Account when you request access to those products and permissions.
          </p>
          <p>Press the button "Create app"</p>
          <p>It will ask for a password from the FB account - enter it and confirm.</p>
          <img
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-006.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>In the opened window select WhatsApp:</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996740/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-007.jpg"
          />
          <p>As a result, an application will appear in your account. Excellent!</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-008.jpg"
          />
          <h4>Step 5</h4>
          <p>Next, you need Meta's business account. </p>
          <p>
            Click on your application tile twice, the following window will open. Now we are starting to create a Meta
            business account.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it doesn't exist, it will be created automatically. If there is one, you can select it, or create a new
            one automatically.
          </p>
          <p>In the left menu bar, click on Getting started.</p>
          <p>In this example, this profile does not have a business account:</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-009.jpg"
          />
          <p>
            Notice: if the FB account is new, then the Meta token simply will not be issued. You have to wait ~60
            minutes
          </p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-010.jpg"
          />
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-011.png"
          />
          <p>If you see a generated token here, we can continue.</p>
          <p>Don't copy this token, you don't need it</p>
          <p>Now you need to add a phone number to the business (Step 5 on this window).</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-012.png"
          />
          <p>Press "Add phone number". Ð¡omplete your business information to add your phone number.</p>
          <p>
            Be careful with the site address - Facebook checks the URL, and if the site is not found, it can block the
            business + the number associated with it
          </p>
          <p>If you don't have a business website, you can use a URL from any of your social media profile pages.</p>
          <img
            alt=""
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dte7upwcr/image/upload/v1669996741/help/EN/connect%20whatsapp%20to%20jivo%20directly/image-013.png"
          />
          <p>Add a description of the company, or just click Next:</p>

          />
          <p>Enter a number. It needs to be confirmed. </p>
          <p>
            Select the option "Text message" to receive a confirmation via SMS (selected by default), or select Phone
            Call to receive a call with a confirmation code. Fill in the number field and choose the way to receive the
            confirmation code without errors, otherwise you will have to wait 2 hours for the next attempt:

          />
          <p>
            An SMS with a confirmation code will be sent to the number, enter, click Next (if the SMS did not come,
            click Back, try to select Phone Call):

          <p>
            If the page is refreshed, and the entered phone number appears in the From field, then everything is OK:
